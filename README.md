# Invoice Generator
This repo is about creating an invoice by using some libraries in Python and Mysql. If you want to run the App.py first you have to create a database and replace it with your username, password, Database name, and table name. This repo consists of a Flask module to get inputs from the user and convert it into an invoice in the backend.
